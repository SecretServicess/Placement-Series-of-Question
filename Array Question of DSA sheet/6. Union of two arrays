Given two arrays a[] and b[] of size n and m respectively. The task is to find the number of elements in the union between these two arrays.

Union of the two arrays can be defined as the set containing distinct elements from both the arrays. If there are repetitions, then only one occurrence of element should be printed in the union.

Note : Elements are not necessarily distinct.


public:
    // Function to return the count of number of elements in the union of two arrays.
    int doUnion(int a[], int n, int b[], int m) {
        set<int> nums; // Using a set to store unique elements
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            nums.insert(a[i]); // Insert elements from the first array
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            nums.insert(b[i]); // Insert elements from the second array
        }
        
        return nums.size(); // Return the size of the set, which is the count of unique elements.
    }
};
